### Unit or an UOM

A unit of measurement is a property by which any object can be compared as larger or smaller than other objects of the same kind. It is used as a standard for measurement of the same physical quantity. Any other value of the physical quantity can be expressed as a simple multiple of the unit of measurement.

For example weight is a physical quantity. The Kilogram (Kg) is a unit of weight that represents a definite predetermined weight. When we say 5 kgs, we actually mean 5 times the definite predetermined weight called Kilogram(Kg)
ERPNext has some built-in UOMâ€™s. If you have specific requirements which are not mentioned in the system, you can create your own UOM.

Go to the Setup Page and Click on UOM

> Setup > UOM > New UOM

Key-in the new UOM name and save . Note that the box that appears below UOM field, which says disallows fraction should be checked only if you wish your UOM quantity to be mentioned in whole numbers. What this means is you will be able to type 5 kgs. But if you wish to type 0.05 Kgs the field will not accept your value. Thus if you have quantities which requires you to mention the amount in fractions, then check the box.
