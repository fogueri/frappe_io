# How To Discontinue An Item From A Specific Date?

To discontinue an Item from a specific date, mention its 'End-of-Life'period in the system. To set your product's End-of-Life period, go to the Inventory section of the Item form. Mention the date of discontinuation for your product.

> Stock > Item

End-of-life (EOL) is a term used with respect to a product supplied to customers, indicating that the product is in the end of its useful life, and a vendor will no longer be marketing, selling, or sustaining it. The vendor may also be limiting or ending support for the product.

__For Example__: If a mobile company decides to discontinue one of its model after 6 months, they can set the 'End-of-life' in the Item form. After the specified period the model will be discontinued and thus not allowed in any of the system transaction.

> In ERPNext, when the product reaches its EOL, it is not allowed in any transactions.
