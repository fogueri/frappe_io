A minimum order quantity is the minimum order size accepted by a supplier. Generally, this is based on the minimum order the supplier needs in order for the transaction to be profitable for them. Sometimes they may accept smaller orders for a higher price per unit. With most suppliers, the more you order, the greater your discount.
