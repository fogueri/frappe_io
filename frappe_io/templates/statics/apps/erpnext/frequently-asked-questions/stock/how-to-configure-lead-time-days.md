__For Example:__ If you are making jute bags and order Jute fabric from your default supplier, the product will reach you in some time. It could reach you within a few hours or may take a few days. If the vendor always takes 2 days after placing the order to reach your warehouse, you will mention 2 days as your lead time in the system.
