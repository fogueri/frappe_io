# Why Purchase Orders Cannot Be Raised On Some Items?
 
Purchase Orders are only allowed, if the Item is selected as a "Purchase Item" in the Item form. If an Item is not selected as a Purchase Item, then on that particular Item, a Purchase Order cannot be raised.

Go to the stock page and open a new Item form. In the ‘Purchase Detail’ section you will get an option to choose whether your product is Purchase Item or not.

> Stock > Item

An Item will be a Purchase Item if it is not manufactured in-house. If you are required to buy the product from outside, it will be a Purchased Item.

__For Example:__ If you sell a product Jute Bag with a flower patch work, and if you buy the flower patch work directly from a vendor; your flower patch work will be a Purchase Item. The Jute Bag will not be a Purchase Item since it will be manufactured in-house by the company.
