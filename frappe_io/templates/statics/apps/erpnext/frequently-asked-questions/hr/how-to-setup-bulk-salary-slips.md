# How to setup bulk salary slips?

To set up bulk salary slips, go to Human Resources module and click on process payroll

> Human Resources > Process Payroll

To be able to create bulk salary slips, it is essential that you have completed the Salary Structure. Salary Structure is the Salary Master which is a requisite to prepare Salary Slip.

To understand Salary structure in detail, visit [Salary and Payroll](apps/erpnext/user-guide/human-resource-management/salary-and-payroll)

Based on the filters suggested in the tool, the Process Payroll tool will fetch the employee salary slips and list them. You can then click on the submit salary slip button and make bank vouchers for them.

If you wish to mail the salary slips to your employees, you can do so by checking the box that says ‘Send Email’

> Note: Salary slip has no auto-generated accounting entries. It is not based on any formula. If you wish to make accounting entries against salaries, do them through the Journal Voucher independently or by clicking on the button 'Make Bank Voucher' on the process payroll tool.
